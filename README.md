The code behind my blog! This website was developed, with significant changes, from the minimal mistakes [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and [academic pages](https://academicpages.github.io/) modifications, which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

(just a note: if you would like this template, I recommend using the minimal mistakes theme, not academic pages, or forking this repo specifically! I put back in many of the minimal mistakes functionality and took out a lot of the academic pages items lol)

### Note: if you are using this repo and now get a notification about a security vulnerability, delete the Gemfile.lock file. 

## To run locally (not on GitHub Pages, to serve on your own computer)

1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.
