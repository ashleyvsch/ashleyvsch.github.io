I am super excited to announce I have been selected as an ARCS scholar representing San Diego State University! The [ARCS® Foundation](https://www.arcsfoundation.org/) is a nationally recognized organization run entirely by women philanthropists. Their mission is to boost American leadership and advancement in science and technology by providing funding to help the country’s most brilliant students create knowledge and innovative technologies.

The [ARCS San Diego Chapter](https://san-diego.arcsfoundation.org/) offers scholarships to students from San Diego State University, University of California, University of San Diego, and Scripps Research. I am currently one of 11 doctoral students at [SDSU](https://sciences.sdsu.edu/scholars/arcs-scholars/) who is recognized as an ARCS scholar. For this scholarship, I submitted an application and underwent interviews with the ARCS SDSU award selection committee consisting of SDSU professors and administrators.
