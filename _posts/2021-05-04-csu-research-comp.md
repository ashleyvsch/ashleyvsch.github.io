I was extremely honored to be chosen as a San Diego State University delegate to attend the state-wide California State University Student Research Competition in April of 2021. As I was chosen for my work presented at the SDSU Student Research Symposium, I presented on the same topic at this competition. If you would like to remind yourself of the work I presented, you can check out my talk highlighted in this [blog post](/posts/2021/03/SRS)!

For the CSU competition, there was a presentation component as well as a writing component. I was excited to share my work in an interdisciplinary minisymposium hearing from other students doing work using chemical compounds, some in environmental science areas as well. If you would like to check out my talk, which is similar to that of SDSU SRS, check it out below!

Excited to announce this presentation won me the first place prize in the minisympoium and a $500 cash prize. I could never have been as successful in this conference without the help of my amazing advisors. Thank you!
