Earlier this month, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the Society of Toxicology (SOT) Southern California Regional Chapter Annual Meeting in Irvine, CA, where I presented my research, "Integrating Network Analysis and Machine Learning to Elucidate Chemical-Induced Pancreatic Toxicity in Zebrafish Embryos."

## A Featured Speaker and Poster Award Winner

I was honored to be selected as one of five featured trainees for an oral presentation, where I presented my work to a diverse audience of researchers, industry professionals, and toxicologists. It was an exciting opportunity to share how network analysis and machine learning can help identify toxicant-induced effects on the pancreas during early development.

In addition to my talk, I also presented a poster summarizing my findings and was thrilled to receive third place in the poster competition! It was incredibly rewarding to see my work recognized among so many outstanding presentations.
