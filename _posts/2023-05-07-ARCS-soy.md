In the Fall of 2022, I was lucky enough to be awarded as a 2022-2023 ARCS scholar. You can check out the blog post announcing this award and find out a little bit more info about ARCS [here](/posts/2022/08/arcs-award). Each year, ARCS puts on a Scientist of the Year event where they recognize an influential San Diego scientist and the year's ARCS Scholars. This was a fun event where we got to hear a great talk from Dr. Margaret Leinen about her research efforts in the field of oceanography.

Over the last year, there have been a few other ARCS events I have participated in!

## ARCS Scholar Picnic

The ARCS Scholar Picnic was my first ARCS event after being selected as an ARCS Scholar. This was a fun event for me as I was able to meet ARCS Scholars from the University of California San Diego, Scripps Research, and University of San Diego.

## ARCS Fall General Meeting

Shortly after the Scholar Picnic, the Scholars got an opportunity to meet many of the ARCS members at the Fall General Meeting. I also got to give a quick overview of my research to the group and chat about all my recent endeavors.

## ARCS Check Presentation

I had the privilege of attending an event with San Diego State's ARCS Scholars, San Diego ARCS Members, and SDSU administrators such as the College of Sciences Dean Dr. Roberts and SDSU president Dr. Adela de la Torre.
