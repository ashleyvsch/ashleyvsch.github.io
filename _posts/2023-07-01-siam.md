## Goals as Chapter President

My primary goal as president is to increase the SIAM community at SDSU to better support Computational Science Research students throughout their educational journeys. When I began my PhD program in 2020, I had very little opportunity to meet and study with my cohort as COVID drastically altered the learning experience. As a way to give back to my program, I am hoping to organize and facilitate many events during the semester to allow students to get to know one another in a low-stress environment. Here is a quick overview of my goals for SIAM this year:

- Update club website to increase communication and public relations. 
- Create a regular journal club meeting for scientific and interpersonal growth.
- Seek out funding opportunities for networking events. 

## Website Update

I am happy to announce I spent some time developing the new SIAM Student Chapter, SDSU website. Please check it out [here](https://siamscsdsu.github.io/).
