abstract: "Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) impart a neomorphic reaction that produces D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG), which can inhibit DNA demethylases to drive tumorigenesis. Mutations affect residue R132 and display distinct catalytic profiles for D2HG production. We show that catalytic efficiency of D2HG production is greater in IDH1 R132Q than R132H mutants, and expression of IDH1 R132Q in cellular and xenograft models leads to higher D2HG concentrations in cells, tumors, and sera compared to R132H. Though expression of IDH1 R132Q leads to hypermethylation in DNA damage pathways, DNA hypomethylation is more notable when compared to IDH1 R132H expression. Transcriptome analysis shows increased expression of many pro-tumor pathways upon expression of IDH1 R132Q versus R132H, including transcripts of EGFR and PI3K signaling pathways. Thus, IDH1 mutants appear to modulate D2HG levels via altered catalysis and are associated with distinct epigenetic and transcriptomic consequences, with higher D2HG levels appearing to be associated with more aggressive tumors."
