abstract: "Tris(4-chlorophenyl)methanol (TCPMOH) is a water contaminant with unknown etiology, but is believed to be a byproduct of DDT manufacturing. It is highly persistent in the environment, and bioaccumulates in marine species. TCPMOH has also been measured in human breast milk, which poses a risk for developing infants. However, almost no toxicity data is currently available. In this study, we investigate the hazard posed by developmental TCPMOH exposures using the zebrafish model (Danio rerio). Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 5 ÂµM TCPMOH beginning at 24 h post fertilization (hpf). Embryonic mortality and incidence of morphological deformities increased in a concentration-dependent manner with TCPMOH exposure. RNA sequencing assessed changes in gene expression associated with acute (4 hour) exposures to 50 nM TCPMOH. Developmental exposure to TCPMOH decreased expression of ahr2, as well as metabolic enzymes cyp1a1, cyp1b1, cyp1c1, cyp1c2, and cyp2y3 (p<0.05). These findings were concordant with decreased Cyp1a1 induction measured by the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay (p<0.05). Pathways associated with xenobiotic metabolism, lipid metabolism, and transcriptional and translational regulation were decreased. Pathways involved in DNA replication and repair, carbohydrate metabolism, and endocrine function were upregulated. Overall, this study demonstrates that TCPMOH is acutely toxic to zebrafish embryos at elevated concentrations."
