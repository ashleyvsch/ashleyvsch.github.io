# RNA Sequencing

[Reference Based RNA Sequencing Analysis - Galaxy Tutorial](/posts/2020/05/deseq2-tutorial)
- This tutorial goes over the full RNA sequencing pipeline in Galaxy, an open source 
web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research. Galaxy is great for 
conducting RNA-seq analysis when you donâ€™t have access to the appropriate computing resources.

[From Gene Counts to Differential Expression - DESeq2 Tutorial](/posts/2020/05/deseq2-tutorial)
- This tutorial is a continuation of the Galaxy tutorial where we go from gene counts to 
differential expression using DESeq2. We even go through plotting and analysis!

# Machine Learning

[PyTorch Tutorial Using FashionMNIST](/fashion-mnist/PytorchFashionMNIST.html)
- This tutorial walks through building a neural network using PyTorch using the FashionMNIST dataset. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to have a neural network that predicts the clothing item given an image.
