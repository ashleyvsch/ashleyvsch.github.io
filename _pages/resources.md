Here you will find links to many useful resources and tutorials I have developed! Many of these resources are developed from my own notes and journey through the learning process. 


## RNA Sequencing

[Reference Based RNA Sequencing Analysis - Galaxy Tutorial](/resources/galaxy-tutorial/)
- This tutorial goes over the full RNA sequencing pipeline in Galaxy, an open source web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research. Galaxy is great for conducting RNA-seq analysis when you don't have access to the appropriate computing resources. 

[From Gene Counts to Differential Expression - DESeq2](/resources/deseq2-tutorial/)
- This tutorial is a continuation of the Galaxy tutorial where we go from gene counts to differential expression using DESeq2. We even go through plotting and analysis!

## Machine Learning

[PyTorch Tutorial - A Fashion MNIST Example](/fashion-mnist/PytorchFashionMNIST.html)
- This tutorial walks though using PyTorch for the first time while building a neural network for the Fashion MNIST datset. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to build a neural network that can predict with high accuracy the fashion item in an image. 

## Random

[Markdown Tricks](/resources/markdown/)
- These are just some Markdown tips and tricks for a website such as this one, or really any Markdown files for that matter
