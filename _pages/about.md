I am a computational science PhD student in a joint doctoral program between [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu/) and [University of California Irvine](https://uci.edu/). My research interests include developing and utilizing mathematical and computational modeling techniques for biological applications. The primary focus of my doctoral research is in computational developmental toxicology. I am under the primary advisement of [Dr. Uduak George](https://georgelab.sdsu.edu/) along with [Dr. Karilyn Sant](https://publichealth.sdsu.edu/people/karilyn-sant/) and [Dr. Pierre Baldi](https://www.igb.uci.edu/~pfbaldi/).
