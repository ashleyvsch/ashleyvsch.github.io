I am a recently defended Computational Science PhD graduate from the joint doctoral program between San Diego State University and the University of California, Irvine. My dissertation research focuses on computational developmental toxicology, where I develop and apply mathematical and computational modeling techniques to study biological systems.

Under the advisement of Dr. Uduak George and Dr. Karilyn Sant, my work integrates network analysis, machine learning, and high-throughput data analysis to understand the effects of environmental exposures on development. I am particularly interested in enhancing model interpretability and applying these methodologies to broader biological and toxicological challenges.
