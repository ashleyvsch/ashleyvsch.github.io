# Overview 


Environmental pollutants are a constant threat for human development, health, 
and the environment itself. The understanding of which pollutants are causing 
the most harm, and how they are harmful, is a constant effort for developmental 
and environmental toxicologists. My goal as a computational scientist is to aid 
in the discovery of toxicant induced effects during embryonic development by 
developing mathematical and computational tools. 


I work closely with Dr. Karilyn Sant of the School of Public Health at San Diego State University who studies common water pollutants and toxicants using the zebrafish model. It is through experimentation we are able to validate the mathematical and computational tools I develop. The close collaboration between Dr. Sant, Dr. Uduak George (SDSU, Department of Mathematics and Statistics), and myself has led to successful and rewarding interdisciplinary research projects.

    <p>
        Tris(4cholophenyl)methanol (TCPMOH) is a recently discovered environmental 
        water contaminant with an unknown origin. Although novel, it is highly 
        persistent in the environment, bioaccumulates in marine species, and has 
        been found in human breast milk. The increase in findings of TCPMOH in 
        the environment and human samples poses itself as a possible threat to 
        human development. My primary goal is to describe the effects of TCPMOH 
        during development using the zebrafish model (Danio rerio) and mathematical 
        modeling. Using microscopy, we have captured developmental timepoints to 
        determine deformities in the zebrafish. A complex network model has been developed 
        to analyze the association between deformities and mortality within and between 
        experimental groups. With new environmental contaminants continually being discovered, 
        the network model developed may be applied to determine the morphological damage 
        any new toxicant may have.

## Mathematical Models for Nutrient Absorption and Fish Growth

        Optimal embryonic development plays a major role in the health of an 
        individual beyond the developmental stage. Nutritional perturbation 
        during development is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disease 
        later in life. With both nutritional uptake and overall growth being risk 
        factors for eventual health, it is necessary to understand not only the 
        behavior of the processes during development but also their interactions. 
        I have developed ordinary and delay differential equation models to quantify 
        the rate of yolk absorption and its effect on early development of a 
        vertebrate model (Danio rerio). The model has been extended from a control 
        space to a toxicant space to analyze the effects of perfluorooctanesulfonic 
        acid (PFOS).
